# dictionaries_flashcards

This is a dictionary challenge where students will develop a dictionary based on the requirements below and then integrate this code into a tkinter pop-up window,


'''
1) Write a dictionary of vocabulary methods and their data structure that it belongs to:
call the dictionary: "python_vocabulary" (Minimum of 10 differente Methods)

2) Access only the keys of the dictionary and turn the dictionary keys into a list.
Call the list of keys: "vocab_keywords_list"

3) Shuffle the 'vocab_keywords_list' using the random module.

4) Loop through the shuffled 'vocab_keywords_list'. 
Print out ONE keyword from the "vocab_keywords_list" called "vocab_word".

5) Use an input statement to collect the response/answer. Call it "response". ** Easiest way is INSIDE the loop, but there are other ways.
Make sure to add a string method to the input statement to match the type case of the values. 
"What data type does this method belong to?"
EX. lowercase, uppercase, titlecase 

6) Check to see if the answer equals the value in the dictionary.

BONUS: add the variables into the Flashcard code and get it working.
